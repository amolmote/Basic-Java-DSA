## Multitasking ##

Executing sevaral tasks simultaneously know as multitasking is the concept of Multitasking. there are two types of multitasking:
1. Process Based Multitasking.
2. Thread Based Multitasking.

### Process Based Multitasking ###

Executing several tasks simultaneously where each tasks is a seperate *independent program(Process)*, is called process based multitasking.


**Examples:** 
1. task manager showing all the processes that are running in the background, all these processes are nothing but the example of the multitasking.
and all these processes are independent.
2. process based multitasking is best suitable at OS level.


### Thread Based Multitasking ##

1. Executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is a seperate independent part part of the same program, is called thread based multitasking.
and each independent part is called a *Thread*.
2. Thread based multitasking is best suitable at programatic level.

Whether it is process based or thread based the main objective of multitasking is to reduce responce time of the system & to improve performance.
